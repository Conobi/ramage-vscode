# Ramage Theme for VS Code

A nice, soft and fresh theme for your favorite IDE, using the [Ramage colorset](https://github.com/brancheLab/ramage-colorset).
Based on [Atom One Dark](https://github.com/akamud/vscode-theme-onedark) (for UI) and [Atom One Dark Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme) (for syntax highlighting).
For the Terminal, [Gogh's Aci](https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/) theme is used.

**Warning!** This theme is still WIP, some major changes could still happen on the syntax look.

**Enjoy!**
